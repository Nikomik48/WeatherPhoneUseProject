# Weather Phone Use Project
This is the repository that is created for the DSA210 term project of Kerem Karadeniz. In this project it is going to be studied on the relationship between weather conditions and phone usage, supported by my own data. 

# Project Overview
We often hear people say that bad weather keeps them encouraged to use their phones or that a sunny day encourages them to spend more time outdoors. But how true is this? This project aims to find how weather conditions influence my phone usage habits by analyzing factors such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity alongside digital behaviors like screen time, social media engagement, and the number of photos taken daily.
Over the next months, I will collect the data of weather conditions and my phone usage, and I will try to find the correlation between them. 

# Objectives
Exploring the Connection Between Weather and Digital Behavior:
 - Realise how different weather conditions correlate with various aspects of my phone usage.
Identifying Key Influencing Factors:
 - Determine whether specific weather variables (e.g., extreme temperatures, rainy days) are more likely to increase or decrease screen time and phone activity.
Applying the skills that I learned in lecture in order to analyse all these values
 - Finally, I need to conclude by finding the reality to make a thing.

# Motivation
Personal Curiosity:
 - I’ve always wondered whether my phone usage is truly affected by the weather or if it's just a perception. This project will help me find out.
Bringing Data into Daily Life:
 - Instead of relying on assumptions, I want to use data-driven analysis to answer questions about my own habits.
 - Also, the data collection process will help me to be aware of my phone usage.
 - If I discover clear trends in my screen time and phone habits, I can use these insights to make more mindful decisions about technology use.
Applying my newly learned skills for DSA in something real:
 - Practice is really important in order to make my skills long lasting.
